## University PHP Midterm Project
#### **Subject name**: Designing Internet Database Applications

Personally I run project locally on **XAMPP** local server only for studying purposes.

In order to run it you should put all the files inside of the **htdocs** folder, which is usually inside of the **xampp** folder on your local disk.
For database initialization run the code inside of **query.sql** file.

Also I tried my best to make it look good. :)
